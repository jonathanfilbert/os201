OS-c

Hai, my name is Jonathan Filbert, a sophomore studying Information System in the University of Indonesia. While it might seem intimidating at first, but Operating system is quite a fascinating subject to dive and learn on. I hope that through this website, I'm able to give you a clear and concise picture on how is it like to study OS here in the University of Indonesia.

Jolan Tru!
Jonathan Filbert
